# apothecary
A tiny Flask website intended to get me to learn Flask.  And to provide wedding information :D

To pull and work on this repository, I recommend autoenv: https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv
The .env for this project will
* set up a virtualenv and installs the required packages (from requirements.txt)
* put you in the virtualenv every time you cd into the project directory

To run during development:
 AWS_PROFILE={your-profile-name} ./run.py
