A tiny Flask website intended to get me to learn Flask.  And to provide wedding information :D

To pull and work on this repository, I recommend autoenv: https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv
* Sets up a virtualenv and installs the required packages (from requirements.txt)
* puts you in the virtualenv every time you cd into the project directory
